## Inspiration

The initial idea for this project came from thinking about what objects we've started to use more since the quarantine started. Water bottles came to mind because they're something that can be constantly be by your side, without having to really thinking about them. 

Our initial ideas were more practical and were mostly based around a device that yells at you when if you haven't drunken water in a while. This could eventually lead towards giving the water bottle some sort of mood based on how much water it contains, how recently you drank from it, and how much you drank.

## Mockup 

To do this we need to find a way of detecting how much water is in the bottle.

## Capacitor 

We tried to make a capacitor out of a water bottle but quickly realized there would need to be some sort of metal bit touching the water. 

Following this tutorial, 2 versions were built, one with plastic and one with glass

Then using the instructions for [Project 15 of this tutorial series](https://rees52.com/robots-kits/4771-arduino-uno-project-basic-component-starter-kit-kt1300?search_query=kt1300&results=1#link14) we tested the with an actual capacitor to make sure it worked. Unfortunately when hooking up the water bottle versions, the readings were the same as when nothing is connected at all

## Touch Sensor

Next we tried to use the capacitive touch sensor and a pressure sensor to detect the weight of the bottle. This worked much better and is much less intrusive

#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

CapacitiveSensor sensor = CapacitiveSensor(2,3);
void setup() {
  sensor.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
  //Capaccitive Touch
  long total = sensor.capacitiveSensor(30);
  Serial.println(total);  

  //Analog
  Serial.println(analogRead(A0));
  
  // print sensor output
  delay(1);                                 
}

## Reflection

We hope this helps people especially when we're all stuck indoors and want to start improving our health. While the amount of water people drink varies, there is little doubt that remembering to drink water throughout the day can have many positive health benefits. 

Next steps for this project would include adding lights or some sort of speaker to the base for signaling to the user how much water is in the bottle.
