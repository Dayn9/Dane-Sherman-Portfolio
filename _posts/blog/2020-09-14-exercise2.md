LED blinks and fades

<!--more-->

# Part 1 & 2 : Blink

I had to manually set the pin to 13, I think the built-in pin is something else of the board I'm using.

{% highlight c#%}

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);                       // wait for a tenth of a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}

{% endhighlight %}

# Part 3 & 4: Adding LED's 

![Setup]({{site.url}}/media/class/470/E2.jpg)

{% highlight c#%}
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW); 
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);      
  delay(1000);                       
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH); 
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);      
  delay(1000);     
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW); 
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);    
  delay(1000);                 
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Part 5 

I had problems getting pin 11~ to work, but switching to pin 9 seemed to work and was much more noticeable after increasing the delay. 

{% highlight c#%}

int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by
const int ledPin = 9; // LED pin, this pin must be a PWM-capable pin

void setup()  { 
  // declare the LED pin to be an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
} 

void loop()  { 
  // set the brightness of the LED pin:
  analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);    

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade: 
  if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount ; 
  }     
  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect    
  delay(100);                            
}
