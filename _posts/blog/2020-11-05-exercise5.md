Networking

<!--more-->

Completed with Dylan Gomer 

# Network Communication Lab

We each set up the circuit and uploaded the Sketch to our Arduino's. We were able to connect to the RIT-Guest wifi and apparently set up a server. 
However we ran into a lot of trouble with getting the client to connect and weren't quite sure how to proceed with debugging.

# SimpleWebServer

We switched focus, and attempted to get the WifiNINA Simple Web Server working. For this, one person could run the arduino while another connected to the generated Web Page. 
It's not quite the same as the Lab activity, but actually seems mor erelevant as a stepping stone for our final project.
