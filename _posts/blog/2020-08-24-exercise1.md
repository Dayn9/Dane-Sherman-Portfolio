I found this project of Mechanical Mirrors a couple years ago and have always appreciated how simple and intuitive it is, while still having a powerful effect.

These mechanical mirrors were designed and programmed by [Daniel Rozin](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/), an artist and professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. The original concept for these involved tilting small plates towards and away from the light to change their brightness. Repeated over 1000 motors and matched with a video feed and Rozin is able to display a large pixel image that changes in real time. More recent iterations use motion capture and use other methods for displaying an image such as rotating penguins or fans.

Designed for an open office or museum space where people can walk up and start interacting with the mirror. Because the mirror mimics your movements, it's intuitive to control and anyone is able to start using it the moment they walk up.

Rozin hopes to create an experience where people can see themselves the way others see them. Or at least display some part of themselves in another lens or medium.
