## Abstract

This study looks at student personality in relation to the college they attend and how that influences fit within their college. Undergraduate students from each of the colleges at RIT were given a short survey including the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and questions assessing feelings of fit with others in their college. Although there is no apparent difference in big 5 personality dimensions between the colleges, students high in conscientious and those who felt they fit better are more likely to be pursuing a career directly related to their field of study. Selecting a field of study based on how perceived fit with a college may be helpful for students in selecting a field of study.
