2D endless runner about making it to work on time. I programmed the parallax and chunking system on a team of 5 using Unity and C# during the 2018 [iThrive](http://ithrivegames.org/) Game Jam at RIT.

Won First Place Overall, Best Narrative Design

Priceless is about the morning commutes of a business man throughout his life as he tries to get to work on time in a busy, bustling city.
