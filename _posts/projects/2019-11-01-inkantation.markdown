This project was completed in 5 weeks by a team of 5 people. For this project I was primarily focused 3D modeling and rigging of a Squid mode. 

Rigging a eight tentacled squid to ragdoll proved challenging given our limited timeframe. To combat this, I shortened the tentacles into little nubs and used sphere colliders to smooth out the physics calculations.

For this project I also developed the world space UI. We added the main, settings, and credits to different parts of the starting room and then animated the camera between those views for a dynamic menu system.
