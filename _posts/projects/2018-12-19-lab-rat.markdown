Game about avoiding lab experiments I made for a web development class. For this I programmed a smooth grid movement system and animations to telegraph incoming traps.

In Lab Rat you play as **Subject #171** a rat trying to survive the experiments of a research scientist by quickly moving around your cage. The researcher tries tempts you with *treats, food, and water* while experimenting on you with *needles, electrical shocks, and chemicals*. How long can you survive? 

### Contols
| W : move up | A : move left | S : move down | D : move right |

## Features

**Grid creation** from center anchor point and snapping movement for smooth but distinct movement

**Indicators on timers** used to telegraph the location of incoming treats and traps. Modified base code for rows, columns, and 3x3 sections
