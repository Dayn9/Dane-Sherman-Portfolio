The virus in this game is a disease that causes itching. I wanted to have some sort of biological basis and jargon for describing it and fleshing out how this virus might actually affect people. The following is a brief summary of that research. 

<!--more-->

* Itching is caused by the release of **histamines** that boost blood flow to the affected area and causes inflammatory response to aid in the healing of the wound. 
  * communicates messages to the brain
  * Triggers release of stomach acid to aid in digestion
  * Released as part of the immune response
  * Increases the permeability of the capillaries to **white blood cells** and some blood plasma proteins
  * Dilates the surrounding blood vessels 
* **Pruriceptive** neurons respond to at least one chemical that makes us itch
  * Type of Nociceptive Neuron with smaller diameter nerve fibers responsible for pain response
  * ‘Pruere’ is Latin for ‘to itch’
* Histamines are produced by **Mast Cells** 
* **Basophils** are a type of white blood cell
  * release histamine during allergic reactions
* **Diamine oxidase (DAO)** break down histamines
* **Antihistamines** block the binding of histamines to receptor sites
