The Itch is a 2D platformer centered around using heart rate as a resource to make objects move, grow, and shoot in order to find a doctor who can cure a deadly virus. The path to the doctor is full of obstacles as you traverse cavernous environments filled with plant life and people.

After a long summer of putting together release materials and debugging, I was finally able to release the game on Steam for free! 

## Milestone 4: Beta

At the end of my semester working with MAGIC spell studios I was able to take the Alpha version and exapand it out into a full world of people to talk to and places to explore. I was able to create 7 new areas in the game and fill them with challenging obstacles and fit them into the story I want to tell. The game has been constantly evolving from the initial ideas I had into something I'm super proud to have worked on.

With the help and Support of MAGIC Spell Studios I've added a lot to the game over the past couple months and refined my process along the way. Directly creating all of the features in the levels has helped provide context to the features and speed up the process. I've also started working on the basic esthetics of how things should look before I program anything so I know exactly how it should work. This has helped remove the extra work of experimenting what works well and keep the focus on what looks good.

The main town area of Basophil, along with the Wilds below the town are fully functional with the final areas hopefully catching up over the next month.

## Milestone 2: Vertical Slice
A demo build of The Itch was showcased on November 17th, 2018 at the Rochester Maker Faire. I got a lot of people to play the game and recieved some great feedback.

All the features I wanted to have implemented before Winter break are now finished (a week early!). This should provide a good idea of what the final game will look like on a larger scale.

Over the next week of so I'll be updating the documentationa and design document to match up with my current progress. I don't anticipate being able to do a lot over winter break, but I'm probably going to greybox some of the levels and keep updating the documentation.

## Milestone 1: Minimum Viable Product

This project started all the way back in June when I decided to make a platformer using my own physics system in Unity 2D. Four months and several refactors later and the physics system I created turned into the basis for 'The Itch'. As the physics system grew in complexity so did the artistic style and narrative of the game, and gradually features were added to create a vertical slice of what I eventaully hope to create. From mapping a text string to an image display to coordinating a dynamic event system, it's been a hectic few months and I can't wait to keep working.
