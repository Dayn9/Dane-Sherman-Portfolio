                 <h4>Step 1: API Calls and Controls </h4>
                 <p>The first thing I did was use the <a href="https://www.airvisual.com/air-pollution-data-api">AirVisual</a> API to create a system where users selected first a Country then State within that country and finally a City within that State.</p>
                 
                 <h4>Step 2: API Display and Selection</h4>
                 <p>I next got the data at that specific location and displayed it on the page. I also added some features that let users so back to select a new State or City within the already specified parameters so that users didn't have to go back to the country search every time. </p>
                 
                 <h4>Step 3: Another API!</h4>
                 <p>Using the <a href="https://locationiq.com/">LocationIQ</a> API I displayed a map at the latitude and logitude of the selected city alongside the data to give a bit more context to the data. </p>
                 
                 <h4>Step 4: Storage and Defaults</h4>
                 <p>I then created a system that could store the users selected city, state, and country when the webpage was refreshed. As a little bonus, the default loaded city when you open the page for the first time is the closest city to your iP adress</p>
                 
                 <h4>Step 5: Searching and Error Checking</h4>
                 <p>The final thing I added to the app was the search box capabilities that let users seacrh for a specific Location in the list. If no city is found or the city selected has no data a small error message indicting such will appear. </p>
                 
                 <h4>Step 6: Style</h4>
                 <p>To style the website I used the skeleton framework with some additional css applied to make it feel more like a map style as well as a lighter font face. The pages a displays organize and display appropriatly at any screen size</p>
